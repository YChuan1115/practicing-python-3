# Practicing Python 3

It's a full material help you learning Python from zero to intermediate! ðŸš€

I've used it for my 12-hour Python course since 2015. It covers various topics, from the simplest for-loop to the classification in machine learning.

The both deck and handouts are available online:

* Deck: https://speakerdeck.com/mosky/practicing-python-3
* Handouts: https://github.com/moskytw/practicing-python-3

Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
